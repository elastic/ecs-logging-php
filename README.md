# ECS Logging for PHP

Transform your application logs to structured logs that comply with the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html).
In combination with [filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat) you can send your logs directly to Elasticsearch and leverage [Kibana's Logs UI](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/infrastructure/guide/current/logs-ui-overview.html) to inspect all logs in one single place.
This library allows you to provide more observability for your PHP applications as can e.g. corrolate your logs with e.g. APM traces.
See [ecs-logging](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging) for other ECS logging libraries and more resources about ECS & logging.
